# kpop-analysis

Kpop bands have taken over the world in the last years. Groups such as BTS, Blackpink and GOT7 have made their way up to the charts of Billboard and many other important rankings. For they are the result of a relatively recent event (the "Hallyu" wave), there is a lot of data to analyze and many interesting insights may flourish, which is such a perfect combination for kpop-fan data scientists.
This project main objective is collecting, treating and analyzing kpop bands data. Additonally, machine learning models might be implemented to predict some trends. Initially, only BTS data will be analyzed.
